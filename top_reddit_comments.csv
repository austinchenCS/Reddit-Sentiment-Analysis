Ayy! 1626 days here! It gets better. But sometimes it doesn't. But it is a fuckton easier than being loaded., 
"I'm 7 days clean today from heroin! Congrats girl, stick with it.", 
I'm over 9000 days free from heroin and I don't look like that. , 
"I am an old fart who was never addicted to heroin. But I have been addicted to alcohol and I know how difficult it is to stop once you start. Decades later I still struggle. And I still don't look anywhere as nice as you =). I don't know if this means much but I'm proud of you and good for you for reaching this milestone. Trust me when I tell you accomplished something special. I've never in my life gone 1,000 days without a drink. And I'm probably 3 times your age.Keep working hard and never give up. I am rooting for you and in the meantime will keep up my good fight. Fighting is all we really can do. The alternative is not an option. Have a wonderful day friend!", 
"Okay, so I know I have shared my recovery story before. However, 1000 days is a bench mark for any recovering addict and I want to celebrate. Now, it's not been exactly 1000 days sonce I've last quit heroin, but actually a bit more. Personally I feel as though my 36 days in jail and my time in rehab are ""cheat days"". So I'm officially celebrating my 1000 days free from heroin on my own regard. I'm sharing different photos because my original ones came under a lot of scrutiny because I shared my mugshot (which was extremely unflattering) and a nice, well posed selfy. Which when shown side by side had quite the dramatic effect. This time I wanted to share a ""candid"" photo of me getting pizza with my mom while going through withdrawl, and a recent pic of my celebrating my anniversary with my significant other. I feel as though these two photos show a more accurate representation of where I was and where I am.My message to those still going through it: never be afraid to ask for help. We love you. Not all will understand why you have done the things you have done, but we love you and we want to help. Please let us help you. We can't help you until you ask. Getting help is fucking terrifying. But dying or living the rest of your life in jail is fucking terrifying too. We love you. The help you get won't always be exactly as you imagine. But in the end we want you better. We love you. We want to help. Ask us for help. ", 
Who would've thought? Quitting heroin changes your hair color., 
TIL that I look pretty much like somebody on heroin., 
"1,080 days heroin free for me as well! :)", 
I'm going through addiction with opiates at this very moment. I hope one day I'll be able to push to sobriety. , 
"My ex is going through rehab right now, and I'm relieved she agreed to it and is getting help. Is there anything I can do to help her after her treatment? What would you advise that would make her life easier?Congratulations on your achievement. It's no small mental feat.", 
"*Make sure you dust the computer box, we want this house to look modern and expensive.*", 
"As a customer support rep for a software company, this is the setup I imagine all our customers have.", 
I bet that keyboard has a nice clickity clack to it., 
the condition of that old af mouse mat makes me think the machine was barely used.. however it was dusted and cleaned every week, 
/r/battlestations, 
Wow even the air around it looks ancient., 
"The printer is an Image Writer II. A dot matrix printer introduced in 1985 at the cost of  $595, or $1,347 today.", 
Type in 4 8 15 16 23 42 every 108 minutes and press execute, 
That mouse is so old it's probably carrying the plague., 
I wonder if they have that old Family Feud and Wheel of Fortune? Best games of my childhood!, 
"They say a picture is worth a thousand words, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcuCZemRo84) a video.", 
"Contrary to popular belief, these guys don't have full immunity.They went well beyond their job description and are wide open to civil liability.And if Erdogan waives their crimninal immunity, they could do time.Source (PDF link): [United States Department of State, Office of Foreign Missions,*Diplomatic andConsular Immunity:Guidance for Law Enforcementand Judicial Authorities*](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/150546.pdf)Edit: Some people can't see the link; could be PDF link blocking by apps.

[Here's the footage](https://mobile.twitter.com/VOATurkish/status/864631567972540417/video/1) without ads for anyone interested. Pretty brutal and probably NSFW due to violence., 
I'm not thrilled about how they'll almost certainly get away with this., 
This pisses me off as an american. This should piss everyone off., 
"Incorrect title. ""Erdogan bodyguard strangling a female **American citizen on US soil** for daring to exercise her right to protest""", 
"Worth mentioning this happened on U.S. soil, in Washington, D.C.https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3581911/turkish-presidents-bodyguards-batter-washington-dc-protesters-leaving-them-covered-in-blood-while-leader-meets-trump-at-the-white-house/", 
Time to call up the VOICE hotline and report this dangerous foreigner attacking a US citizen!  https://www.ice.gov/voice, 
What is this? Preemptive body guarding? What is their excuse?, 
WHAT  THE  FUCK?Happened on US soil?  Is this bodyguard under arrest?, 
My god when I read the headline i thought the protesters would have been provoking them or close to the Turkish guy.The protesters were across the street and the bodyguards go over to them and start hitting them.Wow., 
"Protestors: ""we condemn you for your violations against people!""Turkish Guards: ""what violations against people!?"" *proceeds to beat the shit out of protestors*", 
Was anyone arrested? I can't imagine how nothing is being said in arrests.. are foreign officials just allowed to beat American citizens? , 
[Guardian article with video.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/17/erdogans-bodyguards-in-violent-clash-with-protesters-in-washington-dc) It seems it was a combination of bodyguards plus Turkey supporters., 
Here you can see them kick a woman in the face when she was knocked to the ground alreadyhttps://twitter.com/VOATurkish/status/864631567972540417/video/1 Edit - mobile link - https://mobile.twitter.com/VOATurkish/status/864631567972540417/video/1, 
"As an American, this makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable.How would the Turkish Government react if I go to their capital and start beating up a bunch of their citizens on the street? This is bullshit.", 
This is almost surreal. , 
"Hang on a second -- shouldn't this be a *really* big deal?When I was in the military they made it a huge point that you had to wait for a foreign national to 'cross the plane' onto an American installation (and therefore American soil) before making any attempt to detain them.  An assault on a foreign national *on foreign soil* is a war crime.  Is this different because they aren't soldiers, or what's the deal here?", 
This is why we sent in [these guys](http://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/897770594404139008/1024/10/scaletowidth) when the Turkish minister refused to leave the Netherlands., 
"Charging and beating locals in a foreign country with no repercussions, what the actual f***", 
"Murderers can smile too, you know.  ", 
They didn't say not to draw a picture of him smiling over the dead . . ., 
"The response is ""Well I'm not going to homeschool you and private school is expensive. You bring me the best damn picture of Christopher Columbus you can make because his holiday gets you a day off school even though it's meaningless for adults so appreciate him while you can.""", 
"""Listen honey i know its hard to deal with stupidity in the world, but it is always going to be there. This is the time in your life where you learn to work with those people to raise the standard, to make everyone better. Sure you could wall yourself off from them, stay home and study and get into a great college, but the world and your ability to help it would be worse for it. The cruel reality is we are all in this together and need eachother and need to help each other. But, when it feels like too much i am always here to talk to you and help you through it.""", 
"Show her the wonderful world of Europa Universalis IV, that'll show her the viewpoint of cultural enrichment.", 
">Christopher Columbus was a murderer.""This is a perfect time to discuss ""Propaganda"" and ""Historical Perspective"" and how they influence our modern thinking...a teachable moment""", 
"Just watched this show 2 times through, it's so awkward and funny and depressing at the same time, I love it.", 
You'll be hard pressed to find any historical figure who would meet today's morality standards.  At best they'll just be kid fuckers , 
No! This picture is missing the whole point of this scene. In the end she says she doesn't want to go back to school because she got in a lot of trouble for ripping the skirt off of her teacher.Edit: a word, 
What show is this ?,
