Ayy! 1626 days here! It gets better. But sometimes it doesn't. But it is a fuckton easier than being loaded.,sadness,1
"I'm 7 days clean today from heroin! Congrats girl, stick with it.",worry,2
I'm over 9000 days free from heroin and I don't look like that. ,worry,2
"I am an old fart who was never addicted to heroin. But I have been addicted to alcohol and I know how difficult it is to stop once you start. Decades later I still struggle. And I still don't look anywhere as nice as you =). I don't know if this means much but I'm proud of you and good for you for reaching this milestone. Trust me when I tell you accomplished something special. I've never in my life gone 1,000 days without a drink. And I'm probably 3 times your age.Keep working hard and never give up. I am rooting for you and in the meantime will keep up my good fight. Fighting is all we really can do. The alternative is not an option. Have a wonderful day friend!",worry,2
"Okay, so I know I have shared my recovery story before. However, 1000 days is a bench mark for any recovering addict and I want to celebrate. Now, it's not been exactly 1000 days sonce I've last quit heroin, but actually a bit more. Personally I feel as though my 36 days in jail and my time in rehab are ""cheat days"". So I'm officially celebrating my 1000 days free from heroin on my own regard. I'm sharing different photos because my original ones came under a lot of scrutiny because I shared my mugshot (which was extremely unflattering) and a nice, well posed selfy. Which when shown side by side had quite the dramatic effect. This time I wanted to share a ""candid"" photo of me getting pizza with my mom while going through withdrawl, and a recent pic of my celebrating my anniversary with my significant other. I feel as though these two photos show a more accurate representation of where I was and where I am.My message to those still going through it: never be afraid to ask for help. We love you. Not all will understand why you have done the things you have done, but we love you and we want to help. Please let us help you. We can't help you until you ask. Getting help is fucking terrifying. But dying or living the rest of your life in jail is fucking terrifying too. We love you. The help you get won't always be exactly as you imagine. But in the end we want you better. We love you. We want to help. Ask us for help. ",worry,2

My god when I read the headline i thought the protesters would have been provoking them or close to the Turkish guy.The protesters were across the street and the bodyguards go over to them and start hitting them.Wow.,worry,2

This is almost surreal. ,worry,2
"Hang on a second -- shouldn't this be a *really* big deal?When I was in the military they made it a huge point that you had to wait for a foreign national to 'cross the plane' onto an American installation (and therefore American soil) before making any attempt to detain them.  An assault on a foreign national *on foreign soil* is a war crime.  Is this different because they aren't soldiers, or what's the deal here?",worry,2
